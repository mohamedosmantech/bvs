## Guidelines

We really want you to succeed and hope these small tips will help you focus on the right things to pass this assignment.
In the unfortunate case you don't manage to pass the review, we want to avoid unnecessary effort from your side since we respect both your effort and your time.

* Please make sure that the reviewer can conveniently verify that the application works as expected
  * Put yourself in the reviewer's shoes for a minute before submitting your solution. Does your solution look easy to review to you?
* Find a way to showcase your skill **in scope of the task**
  * You are welcome to implement additional functionality as long it improves the solution in scope of this task
    * This is optional. We do not expect you to go extra mile unless you feel like it
    * We do not expect much extra effort from you. We will mainly evaluate how well your solution solves the given tasks
  * Please do not implement functionality outside of scope of this task
    * We don't want you to spend extra time on the functionality that won't be taken into account during evaluation
* Make configuration as simple and concise as possible
    * We assess the quality of the programmatic solution, not the configuration
    * Still we expect some minimal reasonable configuration
    * Do:
        * Configure anything that you think makes sense
        * Prefer auto-configuration over explicit configuration when applicable
    * Don't:
        * Configure low-level database properties such as pool-size, session-timeout, etc
        * Configure properties not needed in the application, for instance localization
